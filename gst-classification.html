      <div class='card'><h2>Overview</h2><p>GST classification refers to correctly identifying and categorizing goods and services under the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) or Service Accounting Codes (SAC) to determine the applicable tax rate. Accurate classification is essential to avoid disputes, penalties, and incorrect tax payments. As a Chartered Accountant, I assist businesses in evaluating the nature of their products or services and assigning the correct HSN or SAC codes based on legal provisions, notifications, and judicial precedents. I also help review existing classifications to identify errors and ensure consistency across invoices, returns, and records. Proper GST classification ensures smooth compliance, correct tax reporting, and peace of mind for your business.</p></div>
