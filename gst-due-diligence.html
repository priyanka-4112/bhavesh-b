      <div class='card'><h2>Overview</h2><p>GST Due Diligence -GST due diligence involves a thorough review and verification of a business’s GST records, returns, and compliance practices to ensure accuracy and identify potential risks or liabilities. It is especially important during mergers, acquisitions, or internal audits to assess the company’s true tax position. As a Chartered Accountant, I conduct detailed GST due diligence by examining return filings, input tax credit claims, reconciliations, and compliance with statutory timelines. My objective is to uncover any inconsistencies, hidden liabilities, or non-compliances and provide actionable insights for corrective action. This process ensures transparency, minimizes tax exposure, and enhances confidence for investors, management, and stakeholders. </p></div>
