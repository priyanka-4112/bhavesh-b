<p><strong>1. E-Invoicing Limit Reduced to â‚¹5 Crore</strong><br>
The government has further expanded the scope of e-invoicing under GST. Starting <strong>1st November 2025</strong>, businesses with an annual turnover of <strong>â‚¹5 crore and above</strong> are now required to generate e-invoices for all B2B transactions. Businesses should ensure their billing systems are integrated with the e-invoicing portal to avoid non-compliance penalties.</p>

<p><strong>2. Enhanced Input Tax Credit (ITC) Reconciliation Checks</strong><br>
The GST Network (GSTN) has introduced a new AI-based reconciliation tool that automatically matches ITC claimed in <strong>GSTR-3B</strong> with details from <strong>GSTR-2B</strong>. Any mismatches beyond the permissible threshold will now trigger automated notices. Businesses must ensure timely vendor reconciliations and error-free filings.</p>

<p><strong>3. GST Amnesty Scheme Expected Soon</strong><br>
The GST Council is considering a limited-period <strong>Amnesty Scheme 2025</strong>, aimed at reducing litigation and helping taxpayers regularize past non-compliances. This scheme may offer partial relief on interest and penalties for delayed filings. More details are awaited after the next GST Council meeting.</p>

<p><strong>4. GST Audit and Annual Return â€“ FY 2024-25 Due Dates</strong><br>
Taxpayers with turnover exceeding <strong>â‚¹5 crore</strong> must file their <strong>GSTR-9 and GSTR-9C</strong> (Annual Return and Audit Report) for FY 2024-25 by <strong>31st December 2025</strong>. Businesses are advised to start reconciliations early to avoid last-minute errors or penalties.</p>

<p><strong>5. Clarification on ITC for Employee Benefits</strong><br>
The CBIC has issued a circular clarifying that ITC on employee-related expenses such as canteen, health insurance, and transportation will be allowed only if such facilities are <strong>mandated under labor laws</strong> or <strong>directly linked to business operations</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ðŸ§¾ Stay Compliant, Stay Updated</strong><br>
