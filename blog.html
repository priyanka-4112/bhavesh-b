<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has now become the backbone of India‚Äôs indirect tax system. Over the years, it has evolved with frequent amendments, changing rates, and new compliance requirements. As we enter the final quarter of 2025, businesses are once again reminded that GST compliance is not a one-time exercise ‚Äî it‚Äôs a continuous process that demands accuracy, vigilance, and timely action.</p>

<p><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ The Changing Face of GST Compliance</strong><br>
The GST framework has become more data-driven and technology-enabled. With advanced analytics and AI-powered matching systems, the GST department is now focusing on <strong>real-time data reconciliation</strong> between GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and GSTR-2B.<br>
Small errors in filing or mismatches in Input Tax Credit (ITC) can lead to notices, penalties, or even suspension of GST registration.<br><br>
Hence, businesses must ensure:<br>
‚Äì Accurate reporting of sales and purchases<br>
‚Äì Timely filing of returns (monthly/quarterly/annual)<br>
‚Äì Regular reconciliation between books and GST portal<br>
‚Äì Proper documentation to support every ITC claim</p>

<p><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Why GST Health Checks Are Now Essential</strong><br>
A periodic <strong>GST health check</strong> or <strong>due diligence review</strong> helps identify hidden risks such as incorrect classification, missed input credits, or wrong tax rates. These checks not only prevent future disputes but also improve compliance ratings ‚Äî a key factor that may soon influence vendor relationships and creditworthiness.</p>

<p><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Upcoming Updates (as of 2025)</strong><br>
‚Äì <strong>E-invoicing</strong> is now mandatory for businesses with turnover exceeding ‚Çπ5 crore.<br>
‚Äì <strong>Auto-populated returns</strong> are more closely linked with e-way bills and e-invoices.<br>
‚Äì <strong>GST Audit</strong> continues to be crucial for accuracy even though the threshold for mandatory audit has changed over time.<br>
‚Äì Enhanced scrutiny on <strong>ITC mismatches</strong> and <strong>high-value transactions</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ How a Chartered Accountant Can Help</strong><br>
As a Chartered Accountant, I assist businesses in managing their GST lifecycle ‚Äî from registration and compliance to audits and litigation support. Through continuous monitoring, reconciliations, and expert interpretation of GST laws, I help clients avoid penalties, ensure transparency, and maintain complete peace of mind.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
GST compliance is no longer just about filing returns ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building a robust, transparent, and well-monitored tax structure for your business. Regular professional review and expert guidance can make a significant difference between reactive correction and proactive compliance.<br>
If your business hasn‚Äôt conducted a <strong>GST health check</strong> recently, now is the right time to do it.</p>
